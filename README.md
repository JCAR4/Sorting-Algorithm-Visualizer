# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

A Python-based GUI application to visualize popular sorting algorithms. This interactive tool helps users understand how algorithms like **QuickSort, MergeSort, HeapSort, and BubbleSort** work step by step with dynamic, color-coded cues for swaps and comparisons.

---

## Features

- Visualizes **QuickSort, MergeSort, HeapSort, and BubbleSort**.  
- Dynamic color-coded animations for **comparisons and swaps**.  
- Adjustable **array size** for testing different scenarios.  
- Adjustable **sorting speed** to observe algorithm behavior.  
- Interactive **algorithm selection** through GUI.  
- User-friendly and educational tool for learning sorting algorithms.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the ZIP file:
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
````

2. Navigate to the project folder:

```bash
cd Sorting-Algorithm-Visualizer
```

3. Install dependencies (if any):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> Example dependencies: `tkinter` (usually included with Python), `time`, etc.

## Usage

1. Run the main Python script:

```bash
python main.py
```

2. Use the GUI to:

   * Select a sorting algorithm
   * Choose array size
   * Adjust sorting speed
3. Click **Start** to visualize the sorting process.
